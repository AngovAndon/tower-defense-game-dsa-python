A grid-based Tower Defense game developed in Python as a **final university project**
for the Data Structures and Algorithms course, focusing on practical algorithmic
problem-solving in a real-time environment.

## Features
- Grid-based map system
- Enemy path generation using graph traversal (BFS/DFS-style logic)
- Towers with range-based targeting and shooting logic
- Custom data structures implemented from scratch:
  - Queue
  - Stack
  - Graph
- Persistent scoring system with saved high scores
- Background music and sound effects (pygame)

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.12
- pygame

## Requirements
- Python 3.12 or newer
- pip package manager

## Setup & Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project
2. Open the project folder in PyCharm or another Python IDE
3. Install dependencies:

   python3 -m pip install pygame

4. Run the game:

   python3 main.py

## Controls
- ENTER – Start game
- L – View leaderboard
- Q – Quit game

## Notes
- All source files and the `resources/` folder must remain in the same directory
- If `python3` is not recognized, ensure Python 3.12 is selected as the interpreter
- The `.venv` directory is intentionally excluded from version control

## Status
Completed — Final university project
